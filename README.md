# Numerical-methods-project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Numerical Methods class project: **Solving the Linear System Ax = b using the Block Gauss-Seidel Method**.

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement and analyze the Block Gauss-Seidel method for solving systems of linear equations. Unlike the traditional Gauss-Seidel method, which iterates over individual equations, the Block Gauss-Seidel method operates on blocks of equations, potentially improving convergence speed and computational efficiency for large systems.

I apologize to non-Polish speakers as the detailed project report is written in Polish.
